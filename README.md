# HUDS Nutrition Analyzer

We are building a web app where Harvard students can create diet goals and then track their progress based on their dining hall consumption. Users will be able to view the HUDS menu nutritional facts and snap a photo of their plate which will be analyzed for nutritional content and then the user can see their diet goals being updated.
